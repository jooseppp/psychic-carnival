# Dance_Visualizer

## An application with the aim of helping choreographers and dance teachers.

The core idea for the project is to help choreographers and dance teachers to visualizer their idea, artistic impressions on a platform that made specifically to conduct movement through the act, enhance the overview of coordination and overall planning of a perfomance. It is made in tight collaboration with Estonian folk dance teachers and the main idea is to provide them with modern age tools that they can use to better Estonian (folk) dance culture.
